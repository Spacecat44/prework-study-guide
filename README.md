# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

As a Coding Boot Camp student, it is important to me to be able to take clear and concise notes on the topics that I learn during the boot camp. I built this webpage as a method to organize and catalogue my notes in a single location. This webpage serves as a valuable repository for storing all of my class notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. Additionally, by building this webpage, I have familiarized myself with the general process of building webpages with code and completing Git workflow.
